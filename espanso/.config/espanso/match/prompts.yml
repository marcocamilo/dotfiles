      Let's move onto optimizing my resume for another job description. 

      Optimize the bullet points in my resume from the experience and projects sections to align with the responsibilities, tasks and requirements stated in the job description. You are not allowed to add false information to my resume, but rather use the existing achievements stated in the bullet points to reword and enhance them to align with the points of the job description stated above.

      In addition, make use of the skills section and its existing categories to include keywords and important skills that capture the eye of the recruiter and help pass the ATS. 

      Respect the length of the original resume. Do not add false information. Do not hallucinate.  Return the resume in the same YAML format as given.

      Your goal is to make the existing resume align strongly with the job description using the existing achievements stated in it.

      Here's the job description:

      """
      [Job Description]
      """

      Here is my resume in YAML format:

      I need your help to optimize my resume text based on a detailed evaluation of how well it matches a job description. I have a YAML-formatted resume and an evaluation that highlights specific missing keywords and areas for improvement. 

      Here's the evaluation of my resume:

      """
      [Resume Evaluation]
      """

      Here is my resume in YAML format:
      """
      [YAML Resume]
      """

      **Your task is to:**

      1. **Modify the Skills Section**: Review the evaluation and integrate the specified keywords and skills into the skills section of the resume. Ensure the skills section remains concise and relevant to the job description.
         
      2. **Incorporate Keywords into Bullet Points**: Adjust and enhance the bullet points in the projects and experience sections to include the missing keywords and skills mentioned in the evaluation. Ensure these modifications reflect the evaluation’s feedback effectively.

      3. **Optimize Content Length**: Adjust and optimize the entire resume content to ensure it remains concise and relevant, and do not exceed the length of the original resume. The updated resume should fit within the same space as the original.

      4. **Maintain Clarity and Coherence**: Ensure that the revised resume is clear, coherent, and effectively showcases my qualifications while addressing the feedback from the evaluation.

      Please provide the updated YAML resume content that reflects these changes.
